# Hartree-Fock codes
Simple Hartree-Fock codes in Python, C++, fortran.
Hope first year grads in computational chemistry or so may find these useful for their 'Hartree-Fock coding project' 

### NOTES:
- The F90 code has only integral calculation kernel for s orbital and is mainly based on the Szabo and Ostlund book: "Modern Quantum Chemistry: Introduction to Advanced Electronic Structure Theory".
- The C++ code used the integrals generated by Psi4. There is a simple scf.py code to do it if you wanna compute these integral yourself or for other molecules
rather than water. 
- The Python code needs the PySCF installed for the integrals
