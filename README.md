# Hartree-Fock
Simple Hartree-Fock codes in Python, C++, fortran.
Hope first year grads in computational chemistry or so may find these useful for their 'Hartree-Fock coding project' 

###NOTES:
- The F90 code is mainly based on the Szabo and Ostlund book: "Modern Quantum Chemistry: Introduction to Advanced Electronic Structure Theory"
- The C++ code used the integrals generated by Psi4. There is a simple scf.py code to do it if you wanna compute these integral yourself. 
- The Python code needs the PySCF installed for the integrals
